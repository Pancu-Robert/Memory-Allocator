    For the implementation i followed the links in the bottom of the
    README and some function such as request_space() or find_best_block() i've
    got inspired from there.

    I used a global pointer which is the head of the list of allocated blocks.

    For malloc implementation i reused free blocks if it was possible and
    allocate new blocks when don't have enough space.
    Calloc is basically a malloc with memset in case the size doesn't exceed
    the page_size, in this case the memory is allocated with mmap.
    
    For realloc there are 3 cases:
    - truncate the block
    - expand the current block if possible
    - alloc the block to another block and copy the data.

    METADATA_SIZE and MMAP_THRESHOLD MACRO i put them in the header helpers.h
